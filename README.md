NOTE: - 
- Final Project Notebook Link:- https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GQqALX-dBs9veo6bkpaPyk6e9iXTXCng?usp=sharing
- The Datasets are provided in the Dataset folder of the zip file.

STEPS: -
The code for the project can be executed this way: -

1) Open the notebook link using google colab (Colaboratory).
2) Run first cell to import all required python packages.
3) There are two cells in the notebook which require us to provide input files, (they contain files.upload() function)
	- Cell 2 of the notebook: - Upload temperature.csv
	- Cell 1 under Humidity section: - Upload humidity.csv
4) Now run all the cells from top to bottom in order.
5) The visualizations and results will be shown on the notebook itself.
6) The code from the notebook can be downloaded.
7) The notebook can also be exported in your required format.
